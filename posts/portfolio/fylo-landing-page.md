A landing page for a fictional company, with a form to register an email for early access. This page uses a dark theme with some waves to make smoother transitions between sections. It is also fully reponsive, working nicely in pretty much any screen size.

This was a very simple project to develop and didn't even required the use of a front-end framework or library, so I just used HTML, CSS, and JS, although I'd use a CSS preprocessor or Tailwind for the styling, as it makes for a way more mantainable stylesheet.
