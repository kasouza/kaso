Click. The. Cookie. is a little game I made inspired by the famous Cookie Clicker. It consists of a big cookie in the middle of the screen that you can click to get cookies, which can later be used to buy some upgrades that give you even more cookies overtime. 

The game also have a local saving system (using local storage) and work just fine on any screen size. In terms of gameplay though, there's not much to do because I didn't actually make a "game", it's more like an engine for clicker games, but I'll probably expand it into an actual game later.
